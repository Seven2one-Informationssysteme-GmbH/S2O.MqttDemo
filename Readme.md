# S2O.MqttDemo

This is a command line application that demostrates the usage of
the [MQTTnet](https://github.com/dotnet/MQTTnet) library
to implement an [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) client in C#.

Please have a look at the `Program.cs` for the main
function of the application.

The `MqttClient.cs` is a wrapper class that encapsulates the functionality of the MQTT client from the [MQTTnet](https://github.com/dotnet/MQTTnet) library.
